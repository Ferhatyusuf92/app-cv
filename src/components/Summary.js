          I have spent 10 years working as a helicopter technician in the
          Turkish Air Force, where I gained extensive experience in the aviation
          industry. Following this, I relocated to Norway and worked for 1.5
          years at a Hotel Klubben. During this time, I had the opportunity to
          enhance my communication skills and gain international experience.
          Currently, I am studying as a backend developer at Noroff School,
          where I have discovered my passion for software development. I am
          eagerly learning every aspect of the software development process and
          dedicating myself to advancing in this dynamic field. The endless
          creativity and problem-solving opportunities that software offers have
          always fascinated me. Transforming complex problems into simple and
          effective solutions has become a passion of mine. I am excited to
          further develop both my technical skills and collaboration abilities,
          and I am ready to contribute to new projects. I would be delighted to
          connect with you to discuss potential opportunities to collaborate on
          my software development journey.
